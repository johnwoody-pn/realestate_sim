The sunken living room features a corner, natural gas fireplace and oversized windows allow the sun to filter into the room.  Take one step up from the living room and you are in the dining area which could hold a table with up to 15+ guests.  It's amazingly large.  If you have had a chance to look at the pictures, you will see what appears to be a wood stove ""just like Grandma used to cook on"" only difference is the range is new, gas and the oven is electric.   It's truly a piece of art.

The lower level is partially developed with what could be a fantastic sized 4th bedroom with a walk in closet that could double as a dressing room or even a computer room.  There is another room that is home to a great dry storage area and the 1400 gallon cistern.  In addition to this, there is an amazing amount of additional storage space located throughout the basement.  Now let's go outside.  Just off the back door is a large, ground level deck where you have room for your BBQ, patio furniture and a great space to relax and ""smell the roses"", as they say.  A single detached garage beside the house, an additional one at the back of the yard & several other outbuildings give you alot of space to ""tinker"" and store your sleds, quads and other paraphernalia the needs to be kept ""safe n sound"".  You will  certainly enjoy the wildlife that occasionally comes to visit.  Imagine the fresh veggies you are going to be able to grow in the very large garden spot and with the river nearby?  Not a worry about watering it as all you need to do is drop the sump pump in the river and you have all the water you will need to grow the healthiest of gardens.  An 8' well is your other source of water.  It may seem like you're in the middle of no where but in reality?  You're only a little over an  hour from Manning to the south and High Level to the north.
