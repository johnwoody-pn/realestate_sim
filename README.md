A multi-layered real estate prediction model using GIS, economic indicators, and machine learning techniques

# 🇨🇦 Canada Housing Price Prediction Pipeline

This project builds a multi-layered machine learning pipeline to predict real estate prices in Canada, starting from base models and extending to micro-geographic and macroeconomic features.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

### 1️⃣ Base Model
- Input: Housing structure data (size, age, material, etc.)
- Output: Basic prediction model

### 2️⃣ Micro Feature Layer (GIS-enhanced)
- Integrates spatial features like proximity to subway stations, school zones, park density

### 3️⃣ Macro Feature Layer (Economic context)
- Includes interest rate, housing market index, CPI for improved temporal modeling
