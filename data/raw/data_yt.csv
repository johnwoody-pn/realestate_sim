In addition to this, there is an amazing amount of additional storage space located throughout the basement.  Now let's go outside.  Just off the back door is a large, ground level deck where you have room for your BBQ, patio furniture and a great space to relax and ""smell the roses"", as they say.  A single detached garage beside the house, an additional one at the back of the yard & several other outbuildings give you alot of space to ""tinker"" and store your sleds, quads and other paraphernalia the needs to be kept ""safe n sound"".
